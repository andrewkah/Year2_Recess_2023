""" __summary__
NumPy; Numeric computations in python. Enables working with arrays
Pandas; functionalities: Data cleaning, Transformation, merging, filtering

Data Visualisation
Deals with Plotting -- use matplotlib or seaborn library to create - line, scatter, bar, histogram, heatmaps, etc

Key Concept in Data Science
Data - (text, images, videos) or semi-structured data (JSON, XML)

# ## REMAINING CONCEPTS
# Context Manager
# Multithreading and multiprocessing

# Context Manager - is an object that defines a temporary context for a block of code

# Example 1; demonstrate a context manager to open a file and returns a context manager instance  

# def open_file(filename):
#     """ open a file and return a context manager instance"""
#     file = open(filename, 'r')
    
#     def __enter__():
#         return file
    
#     def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, exc_tb):
#         file.close()
        
#     return __enter__, __exit__
    
# with open_file("my_file.txt")as f:
#     contents = f.read()
    
# # Example 2; Demonstrate a context manager using a time series
# import time
# class Timer:
#     def __enter__(self):
#         self.start_time = time.time()
        
#     def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, trace):
#         self.stop_time = time.time()
#         execution_time = self.stop_time - self.start_time
#         print(f"The time for this execution of {execution_time} seconds elapsed")
        
# # With Example usage
# with Timer():
#     """ measure the execution time"""
#     time.sleep(2)


# Multithreading and multiprocessing  (improving the performance of the python program)
# Multithreading; where multiple threads are created within the same process
# Multiprocessing; where multiple processes are created

# # Example of multithreading
# import threading

# def task(name):
#     print(f"Running task {name}")
    
# # create multiple threads
# threads = []
# for i in range(5):
#     t = threading.Thread(target=task, args=(f"Thread {i}",))
#     threads.append(t)
#     t.start()
    
# # Wait for all threads to finish

# for t in threads:
#     t.join()
    
# Example 4; Demonstrate use of multiprocessing

# import multiprocessing
# def process_task(name):
#     print(f"Processing task {name}")
    
# # Create a pool of processes
# pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=5)

# # Submit multiple tasks to the pool
# for i in range(6):
#     pool.apply_async(process_task, args=(f"Process {i}",))
    
# # Close the pool and wait for all processes to finish
# pool.close()
# pool.join()


# Example 5; Demonstrate use of multithreading and multiprocessing

# import threading
# import multiprocessing

# def task(name):
#     print(f"Running task {name} on thread {threading.current_thread().name} with process {multiprocessing.current_process().name}")
    
# # Create multiple threads
# threads = []
# for i in range(4):
#     t = threading.Thread(target=task, args=(f"Thread {i}",))
#     threads.append(t)
#     t.start()
    
# # Wait for threads to finish
# for i in threads:
#     t.join()
